Collection of useful docker images for development tasks

I am preparing these images/repos for use in deploying Openshift origin projects. Most images here use alpine linux to keep the resulting S2I images small and fast.

# alpine-nfs
  Nfs server based on docker image: alpine. May not work for non-root access.

# nginx-website
  Use this image to serve nginx based static websites. Adjusted for completely non-root access.
